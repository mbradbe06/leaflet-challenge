Homework #14

Level1.js is a Leaflet map that plots all earthquakes tracked by the USGS from the last 30 days with a magnitude of 1 or greater by their longitude and latitude.

Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and those with higher significance appear darker in color.  A significance legend can be found in the bottom right hand corner.

Click on markers for detailed information on each earthquake.

A mapbox API key is needed to render the map and will need to be edited into the config.js file.
